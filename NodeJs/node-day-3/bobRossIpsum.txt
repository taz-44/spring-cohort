No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. It is a lot of fun. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. Learn when to stop. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. Let's build an almighty mountain. Let's get wild today. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. At home you have unlimited time. We can fix anything. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Anyone can paint. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. This is truly an almighty mountain. Imagination is the key to painting. This piece of canvas is your world. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Don't be bashful drop me a line. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Here's something that's fun. We'll play with clouds today. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Let your imagination be your guide. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Those great big fluffy clouds. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Use your imagination, let it go. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Just beat the devil out of it. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Let's have a nice tree right here. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. This painting comes right out of your heart. There comes a nice little fluffer. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Use what you see, don't plan it. Let your heart be your guide. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Working it up and down, back and forth. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Let's do it again then, what the heck. We'll have a super time. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way.

Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. You are only limited by your imagination. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. Trees grow however makes them happy. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. You can create anything that makes you happy. I like to beat the brush. Fluff that up. Get tough with it, get strong. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. We'll make some happy little bushes here. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. There are no limits in this world. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. Let's get crazy. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You can get away with a lot. Do an almighty painting with us. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. In this world, everything can be happy. We'll do another happy little painting. The light is your friend. Preserve it. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Very easy to work these to death. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Every time you practice, you learn more. Just make a decision and let it go. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Let's have a happy little tree in here. A beautiful little sunset. This is the way you take out your flustrations. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Every day I learn. Just make little strokes like that. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. You're meant to have fun in life. Don't fiddle with it all day. Let that brush dance around there and play. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow.

It's important to me that you're happy. A little happy sunlight shining through there. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Let the paint work. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Let's do that again. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? In your world you can create anything you desire. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. And right there you got an almighty cloud. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. In life you need colors. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Let your imagination be your guide. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Poor old tree. We need dark in order to show light. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Son of a gun. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Everybody needs a friend. A happy cloud. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Now then, let's play. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. There it is. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Anything you want to do you can do here. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Have fun with it. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Just use the old one inch brush. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Only eight colors that you need. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Brown is such a nice color. Let all these things just sort of happen. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. You need the dark in order to show the light. The least little bit can do so much. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. With practice comes confidence. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. This is your world. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. What the devil. Take your time. Speed will come later. In your world you have total and absolute power. You can do it.

We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. This is unplanned it really just happens. See there, told you that would be easy. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. That's crazy. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Don't fight it, use what happens. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. This is the fun part Work that paint. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Be brave. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Isn't that fantastic? We have a fantastic little sky! Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Here we're limited by the time we have. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. You can do anything your heart can imagine. There we go. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. And just raise cain. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Happy painting, God bless. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Put it in, leave it alone. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. See there how easy that is. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. All kinds of happy little splashes. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. You gotta think like a tree. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Let's have a little bit of fun today. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. I'm a water fanatic. I love water.

From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. You have to make these big decisions. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. You can spend all day playing with mountains. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. It is a lot of fun. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. Learn when to stop. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. Let's build an almighty mountain. Let's get wild today. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here.

Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Don't be bashful drop me a line. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Here's something that's fun. We'll play with clouds today.

Let's do it again then, what the heck. We'll have a super time. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals.

Trees cover up a multitude of sins. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy.

Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You can get away with a lot. Do an almighty painting with us. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. In this world, everything can be happy. We'll do another happy little painting. The light is your friend. Preserve it. There are no mistakes.

Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Let's have a happy little tree in here. A beautiful little sunset. This is the way you take out your flustrations. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down.

You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Every day I learn. Just make little strokes like that. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. You're meant to have fun in life. Don't fiddle with it all day. Let that brush dance around there and play. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. It's important to me that you're happy. A little happy sunlight shining through there. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Let the paint work. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Let's do that again. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? In your world you can create anything you desire. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. And right there you got an almighty cloud. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. In life you need colors. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Let your imagination be your guide. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Poor old tree. We need dark in order to show light. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Son of a gun. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Everybody needs a friend. A happy cloud. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Now then, let's play. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. There it is. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Anything you want to do you can do here. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Have fun with it. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Just use the old one inch brush. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Only eight colors that you need. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Brown is such a nice color. Let all these things just sort of happen. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. You need the dark in order to show the light.

The least little bit can do so much. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. With practice comes confidence. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. This is your world. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. What the devil. Take your time. Speed will come later. In your world you have total and absolute power. You can do it. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. This is unplanned it really just happens. See there, told you that would be easy. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. That's crazy. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Don't fight it, use what happens. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. This is the fun part Work that paint. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Be brave. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Isn't that fantastic? We have a fantastic little sky! Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Here we're limited by the time we have. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. You can do anything your heart can imagine. There we go. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. And just raise cain. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Happy painting, God bless. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Put it in, leave it alone. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. See there how easy that is. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. All kinds of happy little splashes. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul.

And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. You gotta think like a tree. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Let's have a little bit of fun today. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. You have to make these big decisions. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. You can spend all day playing with mountains. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. It is a lot of fun. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. Learn when to stop. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. Let's build an almighty mountain. Let's get wild today. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. At home you have unlimited time. We can fix anything. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Anyone can paint. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. This is truly an almighty mountain. Imagination is the key to painting. This piece of canvas is your world. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Don't be bashful drop me a line. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Here's something that's fun. We'll play with clouds today. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Let your imagination be your guide. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Those great big fluffy clouds. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Use your imagination, let it go. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Just beat the devil out of it. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Let's have a nice tree right here. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. This painting comes right out of your heart. There comes a nice little fluffer. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen.

When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Use what you see, don't plan it. Let your heart be your guide. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Working it up and down, back and forth. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Let's do it again then, what the heck. We'll have a super time. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. You are only limited by your imagination. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. Trees grow however makes them happy. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. You can create anything that makes you happy. I like to beat the brush. Fluff that up. Get tough with it, get strong. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. We'll make some happy little bushes here. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. There are no limits in this world. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. Let's get crazy. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You can get away with a lot. Do an almighty painting with us. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. In this world, everything can be happy. We'll do another happy little painting. The light is your friend. Preserve it. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Very easy to work these to death. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Every time you practice, you learn more. Just make a decision and let it go. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall.

Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Let's have a happy little tree in here. A beautiful little sunset. This is the way you take out your flustrations. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Every day I learn. Just make little strokes like that. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. You're meant to have fun in life. Don't fiddle with it all day. Let that brush dance around there and play. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. It's important to me that you're happy. A little happy sunlight shining through there. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Let the paint work. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Let's do that again.

Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? In your world you can create anything you desire. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. And right there you got an almighty cloud. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. In life you need colors. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Let your imagination be your guide. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Poor old tree. We need dark in order to show light. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Son of a gun. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Everybody needs a friend. A happy cloud. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Now then, let's play. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. There it is. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Anything you want to do you can do here. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Have fun with it. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend.

All kinds of happy little splashes. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. You gotta think like a tree. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Let's have a little bit of fun today. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. You have to make these big decisions. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. You can spend all day playing with mountains. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. It is a lot of fun. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. Learn when to stop. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. Let's build an almighty mountain. Let's get wild today. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. At home you have unlimited time. We can fix anything. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Anyone can paint. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. This is truly an almighty mountain. Imagination is the key to painting. This piece of canvas is your world. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Don't be bashful drop me a line. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Here's something that's fun. We'll play with clouds today. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Let your imagination be your guide. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Those great big fluffy clouds. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Use your imagination, let it go. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Just beat the devil out of it. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Let's have a nice tree right here. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. A big strong tree needs big strong roots.

There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. This painting comes right out of your heart. There comes a nice little fluffer. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Use what you see, don't plan it. Let your heart be your guide. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Working it up and down, back and forth. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Let's do it again then, what the heck. We'll have a super time. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. You are only limited by your imagination. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. Trees grow however makes them happy. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. You can create anything that makes you happy. I like to beat the brush. Fluff that up. Get tough with it, get strong. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. We'll make some happy little bushes here. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. There are no limits in this world. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. Let's get crazy. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You can get away with a lot. Do an almighty painting with us. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. In this world, everything can be happy. We'll do another happy little painting. The light is your friend. Preserve it. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Very easy to work these to death. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart.

We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Every time you practice, you learn more. Just make a decision and let it go. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Let's have a happy little tree in here. A beautiful little sunset. This is the way you take out your flustrations. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Every day I learn. Just make little strokes like that. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. You're meant to have fun in life. Don't fiddle with it all day. Let that brush dance around there and play. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. It's important to me that you're happy. A little happy sunlight shining through there. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Let the paint work. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Let's do that again. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? In your world you can create anything you desire. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. And right there you got an almighty cloud. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. In life you need colors. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Let your imagination be your guide. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Poor old tree. We need dark in order to show light. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Son of a gun. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Everybody needs a friend. A happy cloud. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Now then, let's play. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. There it is. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Anything you want to do you can do here. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Have fun with it. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Just use the old one inch brush. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red.

Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Only eight colors that you need. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Brown is such a nice color. Let all these things just sort of happen. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. You need the dark in order to show the light. The least little bit can do so much. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. With practice comes confidence. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. This is your world. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. What the devil. Take your time. Speed will come later. In your world you have total and absolute power. You can do it. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. This is unplanned it really just happens. See there, told you that would be easy. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. That's crazy. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Don't fight it, use what happens. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. This is the fun part Work that paint. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Be brave. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Isn't that fantastic? We have a fantastic little sky! Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Here we're limited by the time we have. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. You can do anything your heart can imagine. There we go. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. And just raise cain. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet.

Let's make a happy little mountain now. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Happy painting, God bless. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Put it in, leave it alone. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. See there how easy that is. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. All kinds of happy little splashes. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. You gotta think like a tree. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Let's have a little bit of fun today. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends.

In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Every time you practice, you learn more. Just make a decision and let it go. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Let's have a happy little tree in here. A beautiful little sunset. This is the way you take out your flustrations. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Every day I learn. Just make little strokes like that. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. You're meant to have fun in life. Don't fiddle with it all day. Let that brush dance around there and play. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. It's important to me that you're happy. A little happy sunlight shining through there. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Let the paint work. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Let's do that again. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? In your world you can create anything you desire. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. And right there you got an almighty cloud. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. In life you need colors. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Let your imagination be your guide. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Poor old tree. We need dark in order to show light. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Son of a gun. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Everybody needs a friend. A happy cloud. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Now then, let's play. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. There it is. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Anything you want to do you can do here. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Have fun with it. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Just use the old one inch brush. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start.

You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Only eight colors that you need. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Brown is such a nice color. Let all these things just sort of happen. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. You need the dark in order to show the light. The least little bit can do so much. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. With practice comes confidence. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. This is your world. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. What the devil. Take your time. Speed will come later. In your world you have total and absolute power. You can do it. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. This is unplanned it really just happens. See there, told you that would be easy. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. That's crazy. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Don't fight it, use what happens. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. This is the fun part Work that paint. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Be brave. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Isn't that fantastic? We have a fantastic little sky! Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Here we're limited by the time we have. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. You can do anything your heart can imagine. There we go.

I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. And just raise cain. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Happy painting, God bless. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Put it in, leave it alone. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. See there how easy that is. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. All kinds of happy little splashes. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. You gotta think like a tree. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Let's have a little bit of fun today. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. You have to make these big decisions. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. You can spend all day playing with mountains. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. It is a lot of fun. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. Learn when to stop. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. Let's build an almighty mountain. Let's get wild today. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. At home you have unlimited time. We can fix anything. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Anyone can paint. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. This is truly an almighty mountain. Imagination is the key to painting. This piece of canvas is your world. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush.

Don't be bashful drop me a line. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Here's something that's fun. We'll play with clouds today. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Let your imagination be your guide. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Those great big fluffy clouds. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Use your imagination, let it go. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Just beat the devil out of it. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Let's have a nice tree right here. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. This painting comes right out of your heart. There comes a nice little fluffer. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Use what you see, don't plan it. Let your heart be your guide. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Working it up and down, back and forth. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Let's do it again then, what the heck. We'll have a super time. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. You are only limited by your imagination. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. Trees grow however makes them happy. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. You can create anything that makes you happy. I like to beat the brush. Fluff that up. Get tough with it, get strong. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. We'll make some happy little bushes here. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. There are no limits in this world. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. Let's get crazy. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera.

Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You can get away with a lot. Do an almighty painting with us. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. In this world, everything can be happy. We'll do another happy little painting. The light is your friend. Preserve it. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Very easy to work these to death. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you.

This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Let's have a happy little tree in here. A beautiful little sunset. This is the way you take out your flustrations. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. You can't make a mistake.

We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. And right there you got an almighty cloud. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. In life you need colors. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Let your imagination be your guide. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Poor old tree. We need dark in order to show light. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Son of a gun. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Everybody needs a friend. A happy cloud. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Now then, let's play. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. There it is. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Anything you want to do you can do here. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it.

Have fun with it. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Just use the old one inch brush. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it.

Be brave. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Isn't that fantastic? We have a fantastic little sky! Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Here we're limited by the time we have. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. You can do anything your heart can imagine. There we go. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. And just raise cain. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Happy painting, God bless. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Put it in, leave it alone. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. See there how easy that is. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. All kinds of happy little splashes. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. You gotta think like a tree. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Let's have a little bit of fun today. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. You have to make these big decisions. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. You can spend all day playing with mountains. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. It is a lot of fun. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. Learn when to stop. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. Let's build an almighty mountain. Let's get wild today. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. At home you have unlimited time. We can fix anything. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Anyone can paint. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart.

Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. This is truly an almighty mountain. Imagination is the key to painting. This piece of canvas is your world. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Don't be bashful drop me a line. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Here's something that's fun. We'll play with clouds today. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Let your imagination be your guide. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Those great big fluffy clouds. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Use your imagination, let it go. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Just beat the devil out of it. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Let's have a nice tree right here. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. This painting comes right out of your heart. There comes a nice little fluffer. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Use what you see, don't plan it. Let your heart be your guide. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Working it up and down, back and forth. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Let's do it again then, what the heck. We'll have a super time. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. You are only limited by your imagination. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. Trees grow however makes them happy. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. You can create anything that makes you happy. I like to beat the brush. Fluff that up. Get tough with it, get strong. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. We'll make some happy little bushes here. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about.

Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. There are no limits in this world. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. Let's get crazy. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You can get away with a lot. Do an almighty painting with us. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. In this world, everything can be happy. We'll do another happy little painting. The light is your friend. Preserve it. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Very easy to work these to death. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Every time you practice, you learn more. Just make a decision and let it go. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Let's have a happy little tree in here. A beautiful little sunset. This is the way you take out your flustrations. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Every day I learn. Just make little strokes like that. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. You're meant to have fun in life. Don't fiddle with it all day. Let that brush dance around there and play. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. It's important to me that you're happy. A little happy sunlight shining through there. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Let the paint work. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Let's do that again. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? In your world you can create anything you desire. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. And right there you got an almighty cloud. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. In life you need colors. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Let your imagination be your guide. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Poor old tree. We need dark in order to show light. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Son of a gun. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Everybody needs a friend.

A happy cloud. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Now then, let's play. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. There it is. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Anything you want to do you can do here. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Have fun with it. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Just use the old one inch brush. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Only eight colors that you need. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Brown is such a nice color. Let all these things just sort of happen. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. You need the dark in order to show the light. The least little bit can do so much. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. With practice comes confidence. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. This is your world. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. What the devil. Take your time. Speed will come later. In your world you have total and absolute power. You can do it. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. This is unplanned it really just happens. See there, told you that would be easy. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. That's crazy. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Don't fight it, use what happens. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. This is the fun part Work that paint. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out.

If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Be brave. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Isn't that fantastic? We have a fantastic little sky! Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Here we're limited by the time we have. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. You can do anything your heart can imagine. There we go. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. And just raise cain. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Happy painting, God bless. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Put it in, leave it alone. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. We don't need any guidelines or formats.

Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. This is gonna be a happy little seascape.

I like to beat the brush. Fluff that up. Get tough with it, get strong.

I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. There are no limits in this world. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. Let's get crazy. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. No pressure.

We'll do another happy little painting. The light is your friend. Preserve it. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Very easy to work these to death. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you.

Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Let's have a happy little tree in here. A beautiful little sunset. This is the way you take out your flustrations. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Every day I learn. Just make little strokes like that.

Let that brush dance around there and play. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. It's important to me that you're happy. A little happy sunlight shining through there. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Let the paint work. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Let's do that again. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? In your world you can create anything you desire. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. And right there you got an almighty cloud. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. In life you need colors.

Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Let your imagination be your guide. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Poor old tree. We need dark in order to show light. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Son of a gun. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Everybody needs a friend. A happy cloud. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Now then, let's play. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there.

Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Anything you want to do you can do here.

We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Just use the old one inch brush. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Only eight colors that you need. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Brown is such a nice color. Let all these things just sort of happen. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. You need the dark in order to show the light. The least little bit can do so much. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. With practice comes confidence. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. This is your world. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. What the devil. Take your time. Speed will come later. In your world you have total and absolute power. You can do it. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. This is unplanned it really just happens. See there, told you that would be easy. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. That's crazy. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Don't fight it, use what happens. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it.

Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. This is the fun part Work that paint. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Be brave. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Isn't that fantastic? We have a fantastic little sky! Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Here we're limited by the time we have. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. You can do anything your heart can imagine. There we go. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. And just raise cain. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Happy painting, God bless. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Put it in, leave it alone. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. See there how easy that is. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. All kinds of happy little splashes. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. You gotta think like a tree. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Let's have a little bit of fun today. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. You have to make these big decisions. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. You can spend all day playing with mountains. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. It is a lot of fun. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. Learn when to stop. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner.

It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. Let's build an almighty mountain. Let's get wild today. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. At home you have unlimited time. We can fix anything. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Anyone can paint. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. This is truly an almighty mountain. Imagination is the key to painting. This piece of canvas is your world. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Don't be bashful drop me a line. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Here's something that's fun. We'll play with clouds today. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Let your imagination be your guide. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Those great big fluffy clouds. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Use your imagination, let it go. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Just beat the devil out of it. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Let's have a nice tree right here. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. This painting comes right out of your heart. There comes a nice little fluffer. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Use what you see, don't plan it. Let your heart be your guide. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Working it up and down, back and forth. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Let's do it again then, what the heck. We'll have a super time. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. You are only limited by your imagination. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be.

We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. Trees grow however makes them happy. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. You can create anything that makes you happy. I like to beat the brush. Fluff that up. Get tough with it, get strong. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. We'll make some happy little bushes here. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow.

Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen.

We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. This is the fun part Work that paint. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Be brave. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Isn't that fantastic? We have a fantastic little sky! Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Here we're limited by the time we have. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. You can do anything your heart can imagine. There we go. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. And just raise cain. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Happy painting, God bless. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Put it in, leave it alone. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. See there how easy that is. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. All kinds of happy little splashes. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. You gotta think like a tree. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Let's have a little bit of fun today. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. You have to make these big decisions. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. You can spend all day playing with mountains. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet.

No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. It is a lot of fun. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. Learn when to stop. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. Let's build an almighty mountain. Let's get wild today. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. At home you have unlimited time. We can fix anything. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Anyone can paint. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. This is truly an almighty mountain. Imagination is the key to painting. This piece of canvas is your world. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Don't be bashful drop me a line. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Here's something that's fun. We'll play with clouds today. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Let your imagination be your guide. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Those great big fluffy clouds. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Use your imagination, let it go. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Just beat the devil out of it. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Let's have a nice tree right here. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. This painting comes right out of your heart. There comes a nice little fluffer. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Use what you see, don't plan it. Let your heart be your guide. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Working it up and down, back and forth. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Let's do it again then, what the heck. We'll have a super time. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way.

Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. You are only limited by your imagination. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. Trees grow however makes them happy. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. You can create anything that makes you happy. I like to beat the brush. Fluff that up. Get tough with it, get strong. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. We'll make some happy little bushes here. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. There are no limits in this world. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. Let's get crazy. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You can get away with a lot. Do an almighty painting with us. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. In this world, everything can be happy. We'll do another happy little painting. The light is your friend. Preserve it. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Very easy to work these to death. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Every time you practice, you learn more. Just make a decision and let it go. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Let's have a happy little tree in here. A beautiful little sunset. This is the way you take out your flustrations. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Every day I learn. Just make little strokes like that. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. You're meant to have fun in life. Don't fiddle with it all day. Let that brush dance around there and play. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow.

It's important to me that you're happy. A little happy sunlight shining through there. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Let the paint work. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Let's do that again. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? In your world you can create anything you desire. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. And right there you got an almighty cloud. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. In life you need colors. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Let your imagination be your guide. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Poor old tree. We need dark in order to show light. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Son of a gun. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Everybody needs a friend. A happy cloud. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Now then, let's play. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. There it is. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Anything you want to do you can do here. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Have fun with it. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Just use the old one inch brush. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Only eight colors that you need. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Brown is such a nice color. Let all these things just sort of happen. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. You need the dark in order to show the light. The least little bit can do so much. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. With practice comes confidence. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. This is your world. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. What the devil. Take your time. Speed will come later. In your world you have total and absolute power. You can do it.

We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. This is unplanned it really just happens. See there, told you that would be easy. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. That's crazy. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Don't fight it, use what happens. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. This is the fun part Work that paint. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing.

Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Here we're limited by the time we have. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. You can do anything your heart can imagine. There we go. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. And just raise cain. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Happy painting, God bless. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Put it in, leave it alone. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. We don't need any guidelines or formats.

From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. You have to make these big decisions.

Let's do it again then, what the heck. We'll have a super time. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals.

Don't fiddle with it all day. Let that brush dance around there and play. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. It's important to me that you're happy. A little happy sunlight shining through there. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Let the paint work. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Let's do that again. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world.

We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Only eight colors that you need. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Brown is such a nice color. Let all these things just sort of happen. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. You need the dark in order to show the light.

The least little bit can do so much. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. With practice comes confidence. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. This is your world. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. What the devil. Take your time. Speed will come later. In your world you have total and absolute power. You can do it. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. This is unplanned it really just happens. See there, told you that would be easy. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. That's crazy. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Don't fight it, use what happens. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. This is the fun part Work that paint. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Be brave. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Isn't that fantastic? We have a fantastic little sky! Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Here we're limited by the time we have. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. You can do anything your heart can imagine. There we go. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. And just raise cain. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Happy painting, God bless. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Put it in, leave it alone. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. See there how easy that is. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. All kinds of happy little splashes. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul.

And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. You gotta think like a tree. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Let's have a little bit of fun today. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. You have to make these big decisions. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. You can spend all day playing with mountains. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. It is a lot of fun. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. Learn when to stop. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. Let's build an almighty mountain. Let's get wild today. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. At home you have unlimited time. We can fix anything. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Anyone can paint. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. This is truly an almighty mountain. Imagination is the key to painting. This piece of canvas is your world. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Don't be bashful drop me a line. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Here's something that's fun. We'll play with clouds today. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Let your imagination be your guide. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Those great big fluffy clouds. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Use your imagination, let it go. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Just beat the devil out of it. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Let's have a nice tree right here. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. This painting comes right out of your heart. There comes a nice little fluffer. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen.

When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Use what you see, don't plan it. Let your heart be your guide. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Working it up and down, back and forth. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Let's do it again then, what the heck. We'll have a super time. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. That's a son of a gun of a cloud.

Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Here we're limited by the time we have. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. You can do anything your heart can imagine. There we go. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. And just raise cain.

We don't have anything but happy trees here. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Happy painting, God bless. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy.

Let's build an almighty mountain. Let's get wild today. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. At home you have unlimited time. We can fix anything. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Anyone can paint. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. This is truly an almighty mountain. Imagination is the key to painting. This piece of canvas is your world. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush.

Let your imagination be your guide. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Those great big fluffy clouds. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Use your imagination, let it go. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Just beat the devil out of it. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Let's have a nice tree right here. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. A big strong tree needs big strong roots.

There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. This painting comes right out of your heart. There comes a nice little fluffer. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Use what you see, don't plan it. Let your heart be your guide. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Working it up and down, back and forth. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Let's do it again then, what the heck. We'll have a super time. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. You are only limited by your imagination. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. Trees grow however makes them happy. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. You can create anything that makes you happy. I like to beat the brush. Fluff that up. Get tough with it, get strong. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. We'll make some happy little bushes here. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. There are no limits in this world. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. Let's get crazy. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You can get away with a lot. Do an almighty painting with us. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. In this world, everything can be happy. We'll do another happy little painting. The light is your friend. Preserve it. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Very easy to work these to death. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart.

We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Every time you practice, you learn more. Just make a decision and let it go. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Let's have a happy little tree in here. A beautiful little sunset. This is the way you take out your flustrations. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Every day I learn. Just make little strokes like that. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. You're meant to have fun in life. Don't fiddle with it all day. Let that brush dance around there and play. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. It's important to me that you're happy. A little happy sunlight shining through there. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Let the paint work. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Let's do that again. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? In your world you can create anything you desire. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. And right there you got an almighty cloud. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. In life you need colors. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Let your imagination be your guide. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Poor old tree. We need dark in order to show light. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Son of a gun. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Everybody needs a friend. A happy cloud. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Now then, let's play. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. There it is. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Anything you want to do you can do here. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Have fun with it. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Just use the old one inch brush. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red.

Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Only eight colors that you need. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Brown is such a nice color. Let all these things just sort of happen. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. You need the dark in order to show the light. The least little bit can do so much. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. With practice comes confidence. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. This is your world. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. What the devil. Take your time. Speed will come later. In your world you have total and absolute power. You can do it. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. This is unplanned it really just happens.

Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. This painting comes right out of your heart. There comes a nice little fluffer. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Use what you see, don't plan it. Let your heart be your guide. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Working it up and down, back and forth. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Let's do it again then, what the heck. We'll have a super time. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. You are only limited by your imagination. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. Trees grow however makes them happy. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. You can create anything that makes you happy. I like to beat the brush. Fluff that up. Get tough with it, get strong. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. We'll make some happy little bushes here. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. There are no limits in this world. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. Let's get crazy. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You can get away with a lot. Do an almighty painting with us. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long.

In this world, everything can be happy. We'll do another happy little painting. The light is your friend. Preserve it. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Very easy to work these to death. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Every time you practice, you learn more. Just make a decision and let it go. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Let's have a happy little tree in here. A beautiful little sunset. This is the way you take out your flustrations. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Every day I learn. Just make little strokes like that. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. You're meant to have fun in life. Don't fiddle with it all day. Let that brush dance around there and play. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. It's important to me that you're happy. A little happy sunlight shining through there. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Let the paint work. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Let's do that again. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? In your world you can create anything you desire. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. And right there you got an almighty cloud. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. In life you need colors. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Let your imagination be your guide. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Poor old tree. We need dark in order to show light. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Son of a gun. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Everybody needs a friend. A happy cloud. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Now then, let's play. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. There it is. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Anything you want to do you can do here. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Have fun with it. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Just use the old one inch brush. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start.

You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Only eight colors that you need. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Brown is such a nice color. Let all these things just sort of happen. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. You need the dark in order to show the light. The least little bit can do so much. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. With practice comes confidence. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. This is your world. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. What the devil. Take your time. Speed will come later. In your world you have total and absolute power. You can do it. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. This is unplanned it really just happens. See there, told you that would be easy. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. That's crazy. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Don't fight it, use what happens. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. This is the fun part Work that paint. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Be brave. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Isn't that fantastic? We have a fantastic little sky! Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Here we're limited by the time we have. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. You can do anything your heart can imagine. There we go.

I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. And just raise cain. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Happy painting, God bless. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Put it in, leave it alone. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. See there how easy that is. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. All kinds of happy little splashes. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. You gotta think like a tree. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Let's have a little bit of fun today. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. You have to make these big decisions. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. You can spend all day playing with mountains. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. It is a lot of fun. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. Learn when to stop. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. Let's build an almighty mountain. Let's get wild today. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. At home you have unlimited time. We can fix anything. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Anyone can paint. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. This is truly an almighty mountain. Imagination is the key to painting. This piece of canvas is your world. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush.

Don't be bashful drop me a line. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Here's something that's fun. We'll play with clouds today. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Let your imagination be your guide. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Those great big fluffy clouds. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Use your imagination, let it go. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Just beat the devil out of it. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Let's have a nice tree right here. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains.

Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Working it up and down, back and forth. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Let's do it again then, what the heck. We'll have a super time. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Use absolutely no pressure.

Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera.

Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You can get away with a lot. Do an almighty painting with us. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important.

There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. There it is. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Anything you want to do you can do here. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it.

Have fun with it. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Just use the old one inch brush.

It doesn't take much to get you addicted. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Only eight colors that you need. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Brown is such a nice color. Let all these things just sort of happen. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. You need the dark in order to show the light. The least little bit can do so much. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. With practice comes confidence. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. This is your world. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. What the devil. Take your time. Speed will come later. In your world you have total and absolute power. You can do it. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. This is unplanned it really just happens. See there, told you that would be easy. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. That's crazy. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Don't fight it, use what happens. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. This is the fun part Work that paint. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing.

Be brave. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Isn't that fantastic? We have a fantastic little sky! Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Here we're limited by the time we have. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. You can do anything your heart can imagine. There we go. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. And just raise cain. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Happy painting, God bless. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Put it in, leave it alone. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. See there how easy that is. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. All kinds of happy little splashes. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. You gotta think like a tree. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Let's have a little bit of fun today. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. You have to make these big decisions. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. You can spend all day playing with mountains. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. It is a lot of fun. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. Learn when to stop. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. Let's build an almighty mountain. Let's get wild today. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. At home you have unlimited time. We can fix anything. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Anyone can paint. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart.

Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. This is truly an almighty mountain. Imagination is the key to painting. This piece of canvas is your world. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Don't be bashful drop me a line. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Here's something that's fun. We'll play with clouds today. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Let your imagination be your guide. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Those great big fluffy clouds. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Use your imagination, let it go. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Just beat the devil out of it. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Let's have a nice tree right here. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. This painting comes right out of your heart. There comes a nice little fluffer. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Use what you see, don't plan it. Let your heart be your guide. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Working it up and down, back and forth. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Let's do it again then, what the heck. We'll have a super time. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. You are only limited by your imagination. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. Trees grow however makes them happy. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. You can create anything that makes you happy. I like to beat the brush. Fluff that up. Get tough with it, get strong. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. We'll make some happy little bushes here. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about.

Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. There are no limits in this world. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. Let's get crazy. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You can get away with a lot. Do an almighty painting with us. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. In this world, everything can be happy. We'll do another happy little painting. The light is your friend. Preserve it. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Very easy to work these to death. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Every time you practice, you learn more. Just make a decision and let it go. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Let's have a happy little tree in here. A beautiful little sunset. This is the way you take out your flustrations. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Every day I learn. Just make little strokes like that. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. You're meant to have fun in life. Don't fiddle with it all day. Let that brush dance around there and play. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. It's important to me that you're happy. A little happy sunlight shining through there. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Let the paint work. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Let's do that again. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? In your world you can create anything you desire. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. And right there you got an almighty cloud. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. In life you need colors. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Let your imagination be your guide. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Poor old tree. We need dark in order to show light. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Son of a gun. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Everybody needs a friend.

A happy cloud. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Now then, let's play. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. There it is. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Anything you want to do you can do here. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Have fun with it. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Just use the old one inch brush. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? We'll put some happy little leaves here and there.

Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Only eight colors that you need. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything.

Friends are the most valuable things in the world. What the devil. Take your time. Speed will come later. In your world you have total and absolute power. You can do it.

I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. This is truly an almighty mountain. Imagination is the key to painting. This piece of canvas is your world. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Don't be bashful drop me a line. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Here's something that's fun. We'll play with clouds today. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Let your imagination be your guide. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Those great big fluffy clouds. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Use your imagination, let it go. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Just beat the devil out of it. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Let's have a nice tree right here. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. This painting comes right out of your heart. There comes a nice little fluffer. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Use what you see, don't plan it. Let your heart be your guide. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Working it up and down, back and forth. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Let's do it again then, what the heck. We'll have a super time. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. You are only limited by your imagination. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. Trees grow however makes them happy. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. You can create anything that makes you happy. I like to beat the brush. Fluff that up. Get tough with it, get strong.

Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. We'll make some happy little bushes here. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. There are no limits in this world. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. Let's get crazy. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You can get away with a lot. Do an almighty painting with us. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. In this world, everything can be happy. We'll do another happy little painting. The light is your friend. Preserve it. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Very easy to work these to death. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Every time you practice, you learn more. Just make a decision and let it go. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Let's have a happy little tree in here. A beautiful little sunset. This is the way you take out your flustrations. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Every day I learn. Just make little strokes like that. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. You're meant to have fun in life. Don't fiddle with it all day. Let that brush dance around there and play. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. It's important to me that you're happy. A little happy sunlight shining through there. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Let the paint work. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Let's do that again. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? In your world you can create anything you desire. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. And right there you got an almighty cloud. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. In life you need colors.

Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Let your imagination be your guide. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Poor old tree. We need dark in order to show light. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Son of a gun. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Everybody needs a friend. A happy cloud. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Now then, let's play. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. There it is. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Anything you want to do you can do here. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Have fun with it. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Just use the old one inch brush. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Only eight colors that you need. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Brown is such a nice color. Let all these things just sort of happen. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. You need the dark in order to show the light. The least little bit can do so much. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. With practice comes confidence. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. This is your world. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. What the devil. Take your time. Speed will come later. In your world you have total and absolute power. You can do it. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. This is unplanned it really just happens. See there, told you that would be easy. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. That's crazy. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Don't fight it, use what happens. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it.

Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. This is the fun part Work that paint. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Be brave. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Isn't that fantastic? We have a fantastic little sky! Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Here we're limited by the time we have. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. You can do anything your heart can imagine. There we go. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. And just raise cain. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Happy painting, God bless. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Put it in, leave it alone. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. See there how easy that is. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. All kinds of happy little splashes. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. You gotta think like a tree. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Let's have a little bit of fun today. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. You have to make these big decisions. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. You can spend all day playing with mountains. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. It is a lot of fun. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. Learn when to stop. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner.

It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. Let's build an almighty mountain. Let's get wild today. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. At home you have unlimited time. We can fix anything. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Anyone can paint. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things.

Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. This is truly an almighty mountain. Imagination is the key to painting. This piece of canvas is your world. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Don't be bashful drop me a line. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Here's something that's fun. We'll play with clouds today.

We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? In your world you can create anything you desire. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. And right there you got an almighty cloud. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. In life you need colors. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Let your imagination be your guide. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Poor old tree. We need dark in order to show light. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Son of a gun. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Everybody needs a friend. A happy cloud. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Now then, let's play. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. There it is. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Anything you want to do you can do here. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Have fun with it. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Just use the old one inch brush. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Only eight colors that you need. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Brown is such a nice color. Let all these things just sort of happen. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. You need the dark in order to show the light. The least little bit can do so much. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. With practice comes confidence. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. This is your world. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. What the devil. Take your time. Speed will come later. In your world you have total and absolute power. You can do it. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. This is unplanned it really just happens. See there, told you that would be easy. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. That's crazy. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it.

Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Don't fight it, use what happens. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. This is the fun part Work that paint. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Be brave. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Isn't that fantastic? We have a fantastic little sky! Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Here we're limited by the time we have. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. You can do anything your heart can imagine. There we go. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. And just raise cain. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Happy painting, God bless. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Put it in, leave it alone. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. See there how easy that is. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. All kinds of happy little splashes. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. You gotta think like a tree. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Let's have a little bit of fun today. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. You have to make these big decisions. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. You can spend all day playing with mountains. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet.

No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. It is a lot of fun. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. Learn when to stop. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. Let's build an almighty mountain. Let's get wild today. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. At home you have unlimited time. We can fix anything. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Anyone can paint. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. This is truly an almighty mountain. Imagination is the key to painting. This piece of canvas is your world. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Don't be bashful drop me a line. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Here's something that's fun. We'll play with clouds today. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Let your imagination be your guide. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Those great big fluffy clouds. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Use your imagination, let it go. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Just beat the devil out of it. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Let's have a nice tree right here. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. This painting comes right out of your heart. There comes a nice little fluffer. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Use what you see, don't plan it. Let your heart be your guide. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Working it up and down, back and forth. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Let's do it again then, what the heck. We'll have a super time. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way.

Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. You are only limited by your imagination. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. Trees grow however makes them happy. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. You can create anything that makes you happy. I like to beat the brush. Fluff that up. Get tough with it, get strong. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. We'll make some happy little bushes here. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. There are no limits in this world. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. Let's get crazy. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You can get away with a lot. Do an almighty painting with us. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. In this world, everything can be happy. We'll do another happy little painting. The light is your friend. Preserve it. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Very easy to work these to death. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Every time you practice, you learn more. Just make a decision and let it go. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Let's have a happy little tree in here. A beautiful little sunset. This is the way you take out your flustrations. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Every day I learn. Just make little strokes like that. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. You're meant to have fun in life. Don't fiddle with it all day. Let that brush dance around there and play. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow.

It's important to me that you're happy. A little happy sunlight shining through there. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Let the paint work. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Let's do that again. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? In your world you can create anything you desire. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. And right there you got an almighty cloud. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. In life you need colors. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Let your imagination be your guide. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Poor old tree. We need dark in order to show light. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Son of a gun. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Everybody needs a friend. A happy cloud. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Now then, let's play. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. There it is. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Anything you want to do you can do here. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Have fun with it. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Just use the old one inch brush. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted.

Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Only eight colors that you need. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. It's cold, but it's beautiful.

From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. You have to make these big decisions. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. You can spend all day playing with mountains. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. It is a lot of fun. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. Learn when to stop. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. Let's build an almighty mountain. Let's get wild today. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. At home you have unlimited time. We can fix anything. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Anyone can paint. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. This is truly an almighty mountain. Imagination is the key to painting. This piece of canvas is your world. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Don't be bashful drop me a line. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Here's something that's fun. We'll play with clouds today. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Let your imagination be your guide. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Those great big fluffy clouds. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Use your imagination, let it go. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Just beat the devil out of it. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Let's have a nice tree right here. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. This painting comes right out of your heart. There comes a nice little fluffer. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Use what you see, don't plan it. Let your heart be your guide. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Working it up and down, back and forth. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Let's do it again then, what the heck. We'll have a super time. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals.

Trees cover up a multitude of sins. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. You are only limited by your imagination. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. Trees grow however makes them happy. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. You can create anything that makes you happy. I like to beat the brush. Fluff that up. Get tough with it, get strong. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. We'll make some happy little bushes here. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. There are no limits in this world. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. Let's get crazy. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You can get away with a lot. Do an almighty painting with us. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. In this world, everything can be happy. We'll do another happy little painting. The light is your friend. Preserve it. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Very easy to work these to death. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Every time you practice, you learn more. Just make a decision and let it go. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Let's have a happy little tree in here. A beautiful little sunset. This is the way you take out your flustrations. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down.

You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Every day I learn. Just make little strokes like that. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. You're meant to have fun in life. Don't fiddle with it all day. Let that brush dance around there and play. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. It's important to me that you're happy. A little happy sunlight shining through there. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Let the paint work. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Let's do that again. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? In your world you can create anything you desire. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. And right there you got an almighty cloud. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. In life you need colors. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Let your imagination be your guide. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Poor old tree. We need dark in order to show light. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Son of a gun. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Everybody needs a friend. A happy cloud. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Now then, let's play. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. There it is. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Anything you want to do you can do here. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Have fun with it. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Just use the old one inch brush. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Only eight colors that you need. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Brown is such a nice color. Let all these things just sort of happen. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. You need the dark in order to show the light.

The least little bit can do so much. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. With practice comes confidence. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. This is your world. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. What the devil. Take your time. Speed will come later. In your world you have total and absolute power. You can do it. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. This is unplanned it really just happens. See there, told you that would be easy. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. That's crazy. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Don't fight it, use what happens. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. This is the fun part Work that paint. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Be brave. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Isn't that fantastic? We have a fantastic little sky! Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Here we're limited by the time we have. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. You can do anything your heart can imagine. There we go. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. And just raise cain. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Happy painting, God bless. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Put it in, leave it alone. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. See there how easy that is. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. All kinds of happy little splashes. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul.

And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. You gotta think like a tree. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Let's have a little bit of fun today. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. You have to make these big decisions. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. You can spend all day playing with mountains. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. It is a lot of fun. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. Learn when to stop. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing.

Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Let's have a happy little tree in here. A beautiful little sunset. This is the way you take out your flustrations. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Every day I learn. Just make little strokes like that. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. You're meant to have fun in life. Don't fiddle with it all day. Let that brush dance around there and play. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. It's important to me that you're happy. A little happy sunlight shining through there. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Let the paint work. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Let's do that again. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? In your world you can create anything you desire. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. And right there you got an almighty cloud. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. In life you need colors. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Let your imagination be your guide. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Poor old tree. We need dark in order to show light. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Son of a gun. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Everybody needs a friend. A happy cloud. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Now then, let's play. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. There it is. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Anything you want to do you can do here. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Have fun with it. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Just use the old one inch brush. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Only eight colors that you need. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Just relax and let it flow. That easy.

Brown is such a nice color. Let all these things just sort of happen. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. You need the dark in order to show the light. The least little bit can do so much. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. With practice comes confidence. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. This is your world. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. What the devil. Take your time. Speed will come later. In your world you have total and absolute power. You can do it. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. This is unplanned it really just happens. See there, told you that would be easy. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. That's crazy. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Don't fight it, use what happens. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. This is the fun part Work that paint. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Be brave. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Isn't that fantastic? We have a fantastic little sky! Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Here we're limited by the time we have. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. You can do anything your heart can imagine. There we go. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. And just raise cain. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Happy painting, God bless. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Put it in, leave it alone. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds.

Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. See there how easy that is. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. All kinds of happy little splashes. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. You gotta think like a tree. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Let's have a little bit of fun today. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. You have to make these big decisions. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. You can spend all day playing with mountains. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. It is a lot of fun. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. Learn when to stop. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. Let's build an almighty mountain. Let's get wild today. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. At home you have unlimited time. We can fix anything. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Anyone can paint. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. This is truly an almighty mountain. Imagination is the key to painting. This piece of canvas is your world. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Don't be bashful drop me a line. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Here's something that's fun. We'll play with clouds today. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Let your imagination be your guide. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Those great big fluffy clouds. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Use your imagination, let it go. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Just beat the devil out of it. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Let's have a nice tree right here. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. A big strong tree needs big strong roots.

There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. This painting comes right out of your heart. There comes a nice little fluffer. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Use what you see, don't plan it. Let your heart be your guide. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Working it up and down, back and forth. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Let's do it again then, what the heck. We'll have a super time. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. You are only limited by your imagination. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. Trees grow however makes them happy. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. You can create anything that makes you happy. I like to beat the brush. Fluff that up. Get tough with it, get strong. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. We'll make some happy little bushes here. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. There are no limits in this world. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. Let's get crazy. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You can get away with a lot. Do an almighty painting with us. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. In this world, everything can be happy. We'll do another happy little painting. The light is your friend. Preserve it. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Very easy to work these to death. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart.

We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Every time you practice, you learn more. Just make a decision and let it go. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Let's have a happy little tree in here. A beautiful little sunset. This is the way you take out your flustrations. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Every day I learn. Just make little strokes like that. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. You're meant to have fun in life. Don't fiddle with it all day. Let that brush dance around there and play. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. It's important to me that you're happy. A little happy sunlight shining through there. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Let the paint work. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Let's do that again. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? In your world you can create anything you desire. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. And right there you got an almighty cloud. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. In life you need colors. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Let your imagination be your guide. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Poor old tree. We need dark in order to show light. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Son of a gun. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Everybody needs a friend. A happy cloud. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Now then, let's play. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. There it is. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Anything you want to do you can do here. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Have fun with it. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend.

I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red.

Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Only eight colors that you need. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. It's cold, but it's beautiful.
